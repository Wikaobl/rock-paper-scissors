## Description 
This project is a popular game **_“rock, paper, scissors”_**. To play, simply select an image and click '_Let's play_', and the game will begin. Your opponent is a computer that randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.  At the bottom left, you can see the **result** of the game and your and computer’s choice.

If you don't select an image and click 'Let's play,' a message will appear on the page asking you to choose an image.
I implemented this project using **_JavaScript_**, **_CSS_**, and **_HTML_**.
