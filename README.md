## Description 
This project is a popular game “rock, paper, scissors”. To play, simply select an image and click 'Let's play,' and the game will begin. Your opponent is a computer that randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.  At the bottom left, you can see the result of the game and your and computer’s choice. On the right side we see a summary of your games, including the number of games played and how many times there have been draws, losses, or wins.

If you don't select an image and click 'Let's play,' a message will appear on the page asking you to choose an image.
I implemented this project using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
